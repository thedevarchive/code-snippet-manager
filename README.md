# How to Use

When starting the app for the first time, you are required to add a programming language before adding a code snippet. You must have at least one programming language added before adding snippets. 

## Adding a Programming Language
Click on Manage Languages in the application's bar and clicking on the plus sign. Then, type the name of the language and click on the floppy disc icon to save it. You may also click on the cross if you change your mind. 

## Managing Programming Languages
You can edit or delete languages in the Manage Languages page. 

When editing, click on the floppy disc icon to save changes. Otherwise, click on the cross button to revert changes. 

If you delete a language, __all snippets__ using that language will be deleted as well. A confirmation dialog box will appear asking you if you want to confirm deletion, and once you click on Delete, you cannot undo the action. 

## Adding a Code Snippet
Go to Add Snippet. Then, name the snippet in the Title field, select the language the snippet uses and then select the appropriate category for the snippet. Finally, enter the snippet in the text area below the aforementioned fields. Once done, click on the Save button. Afterwards, it should say "Saved!" if a new snippet has been added to the list. 

## Viewing and Managing Code Snippets 
Click on View Snippets to see all the saved snippets. Use the filters to sort them by category, programming language or both. Click on the pencil icon to edit the snippet and its details, click on the copy button to copy the snippet to the clipboard or click on the bin icon to delete the snippet. Unlike the languages, there will be __no dialog box__ asking you to confirm this decision, so make sure you are certain you want to delete a snippet. 

## Editing Code Snippets
Feel free to make changes to any of the details of the code snippets. Once you are done, click on the floppy disc icon to save it. If you change your mind, click on the cross icon.
